Thank you for downloading GoTools.  This geometry/spline library was
written by the Geometry Group at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied
Mathematics.

Requirements:
* CMake - see: www.cmake.org
* For Viewlib only: Qt4, OpenGL, GLUT, Boost
* Linux: Tested with gcc version 4.7.2
* Windows: Tested with Visual Studio 2010. Should work on VS 2008.

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.

(3) GoTools provides a file format: g2. Various test applications
    produce g2 files as output. See the Doxygen generated
    documentation for more information on this format. The viewer
    application 'goview' is provided in Viewlib in order to view
    g2-files.


Good luck!
