Thank you for downloading GoTools.  This geometry/spline library was
written by the Geometry Group at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied
Mathematics.

Requirements:
* CMake - see: www.cmake.org
* Linux: Tested with gcc version 4.6.1
* Windows: Tested with Visual Studio 2010

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.
(3) GoTools provides a file format: g2. Various test applications
    produce g2 files as output. There are no GPL licensed viewers
    available at the moment, but it should be easy to figure out the
    meaning of the data by reading teh source code, see e.g. the code
    for SplineSurface::read() and SplineSurface::write().


Good luck!
