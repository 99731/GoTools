Thank you for downloading the GoTools Core library.  This geometry/spline
library serves as a basis for other software modules written by the Geometry 
Group at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied Mathematics.

Requirements:
* Boost
  www.boost.org
* CMake
  www.cmake.org

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.
(3) In order to compile, you need to have the 'boost' library installed on 
    your system.
(4) GoTools provides a file format: g2. Various test applications
    produce .g2 files as output. In order to view .g2 files, use for
    example the 'goview' viewer. A GPL version of 'goview' can be
    found in the GoTools module 'Viewlib'.

Good luck!
