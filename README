2011-03-15: Removed some bad dependencies of the cmake module. Updated
            a bunch of CMakeLists.txt. Seems to work on Windows.

=====

Meta-build module for all of GoTools including dependencies. Experimental.

The subdirectories in this module is connected via the svn:externals
mechanism. This includes both GoTools modules (gotools-core,
intersections, igeslib, etc.) and external libraries (SISL, newmat, cmake).

More to come...
